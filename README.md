# Typocalypse

A work in progress Unity 2d arcade game that involves typing. In order to escape a zombie apocalypse, you must type. Typing moves your character, allowing you to collect powerups and avoid enemies in orer to get as high of a score as possible. 1v1 features with a friend online will also be added to compete against them and see who can survive longer and get a higher score.

Overall, a passion project to help make touch typing and getting better at typing fun and to improve my programming skills.
